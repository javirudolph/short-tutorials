# Just a repo with some tutorials for myself mostly

I made a short presentation for making packages in R for an RLadies meeting. It's kind of old at this point, but I think still useful, so here is the link to the [slides](https://javirudolph.github.io/short-tutorials/packages/apr29presentation.html#1) 

Lately, as I am working on my postdoc, I am getting into Bayesian stuff and occupancy models. So, here's a go at some dynamic multistate occupancy model simulations and some model fitting. Also, I made this with quarto, so pretty cool! [tutorial](https://javirudolph.github.io/short-tutorials/dyn_multistate_occu/dyn_multistate_occ_overview.html). 

In progress, a short tutorial for vector mediated pathogen dispersal [here](https://javirudolph.github.io/short-tutorials/vector-mediated-dispersal/dispersal_kernel_example.html)

Working on a git and github tutorial...
